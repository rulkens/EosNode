# EosNode

Controlling the Eos lamp via a python TCP server

## Installation

Run `npm install`.

## Running

For now, just call the `index.js` file directly from node, i.e.:

    node ./index.js
    
## Dependencies

EosNode uses a custom python TCP server that needs to be running on port 5154 (this will be changeable in the future).
